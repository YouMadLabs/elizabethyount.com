				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>As the UX Lead for Zelle by BB&T, my goals were to clarify conceptual models (helping users to understand token-to-account relationships, etc), monitor usability through development with ongoing user testing schedules, and introduce accessibility standards to both the responsive web product and the native apps, using TalkBack and VoiceOver.</p>
				<p>I produced the interaction design, user experience design, and testing prototypes for this product.
				
				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>Zelle was the subject of end-to-end usability testing and audits. In addition to this, I maintained a schedule of monthly in-person user testing, creating high-fidelity web and mobile prototypes in Axure to prioritize feature development and design decisions.</p>
				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>I led all user experience efforts as part of the Zelle scrum team, beginning with close collaboration with the product team during the road mapping stages, where I iterated on low-fidelity and paper prototypes until plans with technically solid, testable options were established. At this point, I created and maintained prototypes for new features and flows throughout the development process to test frequently with BB&T banking clients. Product success was determined by metrics such as time on task, reduced volume of support requests, and usersâ€™ ability to quickly interpret key information in the interface.</p>
