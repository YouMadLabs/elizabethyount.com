				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>The Promotions feature was requested by many e-commerce clients to manage the complicated schedules and logic of large amounts of online promotions. The new feature needed to help users understand and manage overlapping promotion types, recurring schedules, and constraints quickly and easily. Before design began, I used competitive analysis, user surveys, and feedback from my team’s user community forums to define basic user needs and important features.</p>
			
				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>With a limited research budget, I used a combination of remote, unmoderated user testing combined with in-person A/B testing and moderated testing with existing users. I scheduled remote tests biweekly to monitor progress and usability throughout the design phase, and also used existing retail user research to form hypotheses for tests. I gauged the success of designs by a combination of time-on-task and workflow assessments, as well as longer-term metrics such as renewals and NPS scores from e- commerce clients.</p>
				
				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>For this project, after initial sketching and user flow development, I moved quickly to medium-fidelity Axure prototypes (I found through trial and error that lower-fidelity prototypes don’t work well for remote/unmoderated tests) to get quick results from UserZoom and UserTesting. Because this project took place during the team’s efforts to become Lightning Certified, final assets were often delivered as heavily-documented images with links to appropriate Lightning design system components.</p>
