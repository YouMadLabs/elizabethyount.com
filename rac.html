				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>RAC Auto was an all-new native iOS and Android app for Regional Acceptance auto loan holders. As UX lead, I was involved from the beginning of the project, handling interaction and UX design and documentation for our technical teams, high-fidelity prototyping, and user research.</p>
				
				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>I synthesized initial data about our client base (device type, type of loan held, socio- economic factors, etc) to inform early designs. Early on in the project, I scheduled recurring biweekly usability testing sessions to monitor intuitiveness and accessibility of new features. After design direction was more defined, RAC Auto underwent a full week dedicated study with test participants recruited to closely match our user demographic.</p>
				
				<h4>Process</h4>
				<p>In the initial phase of design, I created low-fidelity wireframes and sketches to verify technical feasibility and direction with the product team. After this stage, I created and maintained a high-fidelity Axure prototype for user testing efforts throughout the development lifecycle. During research planning for the on-site weeklong study, I developed screener criteria to find participants that most closely represented RAC users.</p>
